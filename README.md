## Loteria!

> Loteria is like bingo but a little more interactive. It’s a classic Mexican game that has images instead of numbers on the boards. Usually, the caller would sing out a riddle (in my game no riddle just a random generated card) and then place a token on your board if you have it. The first player to get 3 tokens in a row and call out “¡Lotería!” wins. It’s also a good way to pick up some words in Spanish.


<!-- 
- I would have to work with only one board of sixteen cards, maybe build upon it later.
- I would write some logic to check the board actually has the cards randomly generated and use some divs and css for each row also buttons to click on the board.

1. Player 1 = User and Player 2 the computer/card dealer
2. Win state = 3 tokens in a row
3. Lose state = missing one of the randomly generated cards
4. Keep playing if the game is not over = 
5. Multiple rounds to play =
